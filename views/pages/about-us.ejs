      <p id="jasonp" class="intro">Hi, I’m Jason. I’m originally from upstate New York before moving out west to the
        mountains of
        California and
        later here. I’m an organized, ethically driven punctual worker. I grew up with a software developer for a father
        and have loved all kinds of technology for as long as I can remember. I’ve always been the person to help people
        fix their problems. I have worked in the security, customer service and labor industries my whole life. It was
        while working in these positions that I realized how important company values were to me. I want my work to be
        representative of my own values. I’m a software developer with strong technical skills, ethical motivation and a
        knack for troubleshooting of all kinds. I believe this makes me a uniquely suited fit for any tech company.

      <p id="shayp" class="intro">Before I dove into the tech world I worked a host of different jobs, primarily in
        customer service.
        I enjoyed
        solving problems for my customers but the same problems on repeat left me less engaged than I'd like. I had
        previous experience managing an eccomerce website and I thoroughly enjoyed implementing apps to make the site
        more engaging to our customers. I find customer feedback an excellent inspiration to create better experiences
        and I'd love to integrate that passion into my work as a developer.</p>
