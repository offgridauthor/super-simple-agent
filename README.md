# superSimpleAgent

**Authors**: Seamus Brown, Clement Buchanan, Sang Lee, Jason Quaglia

**Version**: Collection 1.5.6

## Overview

This is our code 301 Final Project while at Code Fellows. This is an app that helps you parse through the data received from an API call. Instead of trying to `console.log()` to parse through data in your own project, put the API link into our app to see the JSON object and get the relevant data (Remember, __no__ API keys!). Our app will even give you the direct JavaScript that you need to access the data in your own project.

## Problem Domain

As a user I want to see the info returned from API queries in a visually pleasant format so I don't have to spend hours parsing through unformatted console logs. I'd also like to see what other API's are out there that I might be able to use on my projects.

## Getting Started (local server)

1. Install packages: run `npm init`; then run `npm install` to get express, cors, pg, dotenv, superagent, fecha, pretty-print-json
2. Once in IDE: add `.env` file, include: `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL` info
3. Connect to database using psql: database name is associated with the `DATABASE_URL` info and the table name can be found in the `schema.sql` file
4. Start nodemon

## Architecture

This is a mobile first app. The client is build using [EJS](https://ejs.co/) and is styled using CSS. The backend is built using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). It uses [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for its database and [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform) as the cloud platform for deployment. The code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) on the team's [superSimpleAgent](https://github.com/jquaglia/super-simple-agent) repository.
